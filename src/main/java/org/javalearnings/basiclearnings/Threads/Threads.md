# 
What is Exception

>An Exception in programming is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. This can occur for various reasons, such as invalid user input, failure of a physical device, failed network connections, etc.

>In Java, Exceptions are objects that are thrown when an error occurs during the execution of the program. These exceptions can be caught and handled using the try, catch, and finally keywords. If not handled, they can cause the program to terminate unexpectedly
